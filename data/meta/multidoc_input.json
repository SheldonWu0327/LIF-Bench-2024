FEMA, which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for the oversight and management of NFIP. Since NFIP’s inception, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen the program. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 made flood insurance mandatory for owners of properties in vulnerable areas who had mortgages from federally regulated lenders and provided additional incentives for communities to join the program. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory purchase requirements for owners of properties located in special flood hazard areas (SFHA) with mortgages from federally regulated lenders.

Apple was the first type. Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design one, so he did.

Logistics support for almost all of DOD’s weapon systems, such as materiel management, maintenance, and engineering, is provided by a combination of government and private-sector sources. In the past, under traditional support arrangements, the government generally managed the provision of weapon system support, using a combination of support providers from the government and the private sector. PBL support arrangements often use a private-sector support integrator to manage support providers from both the public and private sectors to meet specified performance requirements. PBL evolved from performance-based service contracting, which has been used in both the public and private sectors.

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.",

The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate all risks, as that is an impossible task. Rather, given limited resources, risk management is a structured means of making informed trade-offs and choices about how to use available resources effectively and monitoring the effect of those choices. Thus, risk management is a continuous process that includes the assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine what actions should be taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these elements of risk. To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk management, GAO developed a framework for risk management based on best practices and other criteria. The framework is divided into five phases: (1) setting strategic goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks; (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4",

A key step in this process is the enrichment of natural uranium, which increases its concentration of uranium-235, the isotope of uranium that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts of energy. Before it can be enriched, natural uranium must be chemically converted into uranium hexafluoride. The enrichment process results in two principal products: (1) enriched uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed for specific uses, such as nuclear weapons or fuel for nuclear power plants; and (2) leftover “tails” of uranium hexafluoride. These tails are also known as depleted uranium because the material is depleted in uranium-235 compared with natural uranium. Since 1993, uranium enrichment activities at DOE-owned uranium enrichment plants have been performed by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC), formerly a wholly owned government corporation that",

        "text": "The United States is currently undergoing a transition from analog to digital broadcast television. With traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into “waveform” electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. Digital transmission of television signals provides several advantages compared to analog transmission, such as enabling better quality picture and sound reception as well as using the radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than analog transmission. This increased efficiency makes multicasting—where several digital television signals are transmitted in the same amount of spectrum necessary for one analog television signal—and HDTV services possible. A primary goal of the DTV transition is for the federal government to reclaim spectrum that broadcasters currently use to provide analog television signals. The radiofrequency spectrum is a medium that enables many forms of wireless communications, such as mobile telephone, paging, broadcast television and radio, private radio systems, and satellite services.

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

        "text": "When people say that in their experience all programming languages are basically equivalent, they're making a statement not about languages but about the kind of programming they've done.\n\n99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.\n\nBut the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.\n\nWeird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.\n\nA concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.\n\nSo if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.\n\n**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.",

To do so, it created basic organizational and acquisition infrastructures. To date, however, TSA has not developed an acquisition infrastructure that facilitates successful management and execution of acquisition activities, helps ensure that the agency acquires quality goods and services at reasonable prices, and supports informed decisions about acquisition strategy. Specifically, our review of TSA’s acquisition function and inspector general reports identified a number of challenges in each of the four areas we assessed. Organizational alignment and leadership: TSA’s Office of Acquisition is at an organizational level too low to oversee the acquisition process, coordinate acquisition activities, and enforce acquisition policies effectively. The position of the office hinders its ability to help ensure that TSA follows the acquisition processes that enable the agency to get the best value on goods and services. Senior acquisition officials told us that the Office of Acquisition is not appropriately placed",

However, some important changes in the way they provide meals have taken place since the 1980s. Some food authorities have contracted with private food service management companies (FSMC) to operate their school food services.

According to the CBP officials we interviewed for our report, as resources increased, Border Patrol sought to move enforcement closer to the border over time to better position the agency to ensure the arrest of those trying to enter the country illegally. Additionally, headquarters and field officials said station supervisors determined (1) whether to deploy agents in border zones or interior zones, and (2) the types of enforcement or nonenforcement activities agents were to perform. Similarly, Border Patrol officials from the five sectors we visited stated that they used similar factors in making deployment decisions, such as intelligence showing the presence of threat across",

If this happens, the issuance of benefits and the provision of medical care that veterans rely on could be delayed or interrupted.

The problem with not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness. Unless you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain suggests you're a marginal company. Whereas (as Stripe shows) having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you do.\n\nEven good founders can be in denial about this. Their denial derives from two very powerful forces: identity, and lack of imagination.\n\nX is what we _are_, founders think. There's no other name as good. Both of which are false.\n\nYou can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagine you'd called your company something else. If you had, surely you'd be just as attached to that name",

In 1912, President Taft established an Office of Naval and Petroleum Oil Shale Reserves, and between 1916 and 1924, executive orders set aside federal land in three separate naval oil shale reserves to ensure an emergency domestic supply of oil. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 made petroleum and oil shale resources on federal lands available for development under the terms of a mineral lease, but large domestic oil discoveries soon after passage of the act dampened interest in oil shale. Interest resumed at various points during times of generally increasing oil prices. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Mines developed an oil shale demonstration project beginning in 1949 in Colorado, where it attempted to develop a process to extract the oil. The 1970s’ energy crises stimulated interest once again, and DOE partnered with a number of energy companies, spawning a host of demonstration projects",

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

This law requires each federal department and agency to prepare plans to maintain an affirmative program of equal employment opportunity and establish training and education programs. Pursuant to this and other authorities, EEOC establishes equal employment",

        "text": "The federal and Commonwealth governments have had a long-term interest in policies to stimulate economic growth in Puerto Rico. Historically, the centerpiece of these policies has been the combination of the possessions tax credit in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and extensive tax incentives in the Puerto Rican tax code for U.S. and foreign businesses. In the early 1990s Congress became dissatisfied with the effectiveness of the credit and introduced restrictions to better target employment-generating activities. Then in 1996 Congress repealed the credit but allowed existing possessions corporations to earn either the possessions credit or a replacement credit during a 10-year phaseout period ending in 2006. Various proposals have been placed before Congress for some form of replacement assistance to the Puerto Rican economy. Congress could better assess the merits of the various proposals if it had more complete information relating to the recent performance of the Puerto Rican economy, the current treatment that Commonwealth residents receive under both federal tax policies and federal social programs, and information relating to the",

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

The new council would include the President, several cabinet secretaries, and other selected high-level officials. An Executive Director with a staff would collaborate with executive agencies to assess threats; develop a national strategy; analyze and prioritize governmentwide budgets; and provide oversight of implementation among the different federal agencies. In principle, the creation of the new council and its specific duties appear to implement key actions needed to combat terrorism that we have identified in previous reviews. Following is a discussion of those actions, executive branch attempts to implement them, and how H.R. 525 would address them. In our May 2000 testimony, we reported that overall federal efforts to combat terrorism were fragmented. There are at least two top officials responsible for combating terrorism and both of them",

The contractors explained in a report issued 60 days after the June 1997 test that the test achieved its primary objectives, but that some sensor abnormalities were noted. For example, while the report explained that the sensor detected the deployed targets and collected some usable target signals, the report also stated that some sensor components did not operate as desired and the sensor often detected targets where there were none. In December 1997, the contractors documented other test anomalies. According to briefing charts prepared for a December meeting, the Boeing sensor tested in Integrated Flight Test 1A had a low probability of detection; the sensor’s software was not always confident that it had correctly identified some target objects; the software significantly increased the rank of one target object toward the end of the flight; and in-flight calibration of the",

The number of current illicit drug users has remained relatively static since 1992. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug, with about 10.1 million users in 1996. About half (54 percent) of the 1996 illicit drug users used marijuana only, while another 23 percent used marijuana and one or more other drugs. The remaining 23 percent of illicit drug users used only a drug other than marijuana. The number of current cocaine users declined from 5.7 million people in 1985 to 1.75 million in 1996. The estimated number of crack cocaine users in 1996 was about 668,000 and has remained steady at about this level since",

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

The decision also means about 400 posts will be lost at the authority.",

College was regarded as job training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do. Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.\n\nBut I had some more honest motives as well. I thought studying philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom. All the people majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain knowledge. I would be learning what was really what.\n\nI'd tried to read a few philosophy books. Not recent ones; you wouldn't find those in our high school library. But I tried to read Plato and Aristotle. I doubt I believed I understood them, but they sounded like they were talking about something important. I assumed I'd learn what in college",

The web lets readers respond, and increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their own blog posts.\n\nMany who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say. You could expand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications. When you disagree you're entering territory he may not have explored.\n\nThe result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially measured by the word. That doesn't mean people are getting angrier. The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier. Particularly online, where it's easy to say things you'd never say face to face.\n\nIf we're all going to be disagree",

I understand Pittsburgh pretty well, because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon Valley pretty well because that's where I live now. Could you get that kind of startup ecosystem going here?\n\nWhen I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a very optimistic talk. I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh could do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.

Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement program, under which the federal government is obligated to pay its share of expenditures for covered services provided to eligible individuals under each state’s federally approved Medicaid plan. States operate their Medicaid programs by paying qualified health care providers for a range of covered services provided to eligible beneficiaries and then seeking reimbursement for the federal share of those payments. CMS has an important role in ensuring that states comply with certain statutory Medicaid payment principles when claiming federal reimbursements for payments made to institutional and other providers who serve Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, Medicaid payments by law must be “consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality care,” and states must share in Medicaid costs in proportions established according to a statutory formula. Within broad federal requirements, each state administers and operates its Medicaid program in accordance with a state Medicaid plan, which must be approved by CMS.",

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases.

The departments of Transportation (DOT) and State have traditionally negotiated these agreements as part of a comprehensive exchange covering both passenger and air cargo services. However, air cargo services have characteristics and needs that differ significantly from those of passenger services—most prominently the need to move and store cargo on the ground.

Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.\n\nThe striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different from most people's idea of what business is like. If you looked in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing \"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to read.

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

However, because of public concern about the potential effects of these methods of disposal on public health and the environment, they were discontinued during the 1970s. In 1985, the Congress required the Department of Defense (DOD) to carry out the destruction of the U.S. stockpile of chemical agents and munitions and establish an organization within the Army to be responsible for the disposal program.

        "text": "The unique characteristics and relative abundance of wood have made it a natural material for a variety of uses, including homes and other structures, furniture, tools, vehicles, and decorative objects. Because wood varies in characteristics and volume by species, it may be heavy or light, stiff or flexible, and hard or soft. Federal agencies conduct research on the range of processes that occur between the time a tree is grown in the forest to the time it becomes a wood product and then is recycled. For purposes of our review, wood utilization research and product development refers to the activities that occur from harvesting the wood through the recycling of wood and paper products. (See fig. 1.) According to the North American Industry Classification System, the U.S. forest products industry is divided into two sectors: wood product manufacturing and pulp and paper manufacturing. The wood product manufacturing sector comprises small companies, while the pulp and paper manufacturing sector tends to have fewer, larger companies. The wood product manufacturing sector can be broken into three sub",

        "text": "One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.\n\nThere are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.\n\nWhen you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you're done.\n\nMost powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.\n\nWhen",

The point of programming languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being overwhelmed by a mass of detail.\n\nArchitects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal than others. One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems is designing bridges. There your job is largely a matter of spanning a given distance with the least material. The other end of the spectrum is designing chairs. Chair designers have to spend their time thinking about human butts.\n\nSoftware varies in the same way.

The capability of the equipment to detect nuclear material depends on many factors, including the amount of material, the size and capacity of the detection device, the distance from the detection device to the nuclear material, and whether the material is shielded from detection. Detecting actual cases of illicit trafficking in weapons-usable nuclear material is complicated because one of the materials that is of greatest concern—highly enriched uranium—is among the most difficult materials to detect because of its relatively low level of radioactivity. In contrast, medical and industrial radioactive sources, which could be used in a radiological dispersion device (or “dirty bomb”), are highly radioactive and easier to detect. Because of the complexities of detecting and identifying nuclear material, customs officers and border guards who are responsible for operating detection equipment must also be trained",

Private sector pension plans are classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans promise to provide, generally, a fixed level of monthly retirement income that is based on salary, years of service, and age at retirement regardless of how the plan’s investments perform. In contrast, benefits from defined contribution plans are based on the contributions to and the performance of the investments in individual accounts, which may fluctuate in value. Examples of defined contribution plans include 401(k) profit-sharing and thrift-savings plans, stock bonus plans, and annuity plans. Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) oversees 401(k) plans—including the fees associated with running the plans— because they are considered employee benefit plans under ERISA. Enacted before 401(k) plans came into wide use, ERISA establishes the responsibilities of employee benefit plan decision makers and the requirements for disclosing and reporting plan fees.",

States determine the percentage of funds that will be allocated to the secondary and postsecondary levels.

A performance-based approach to federal service contracting was introduced during the 1990s, representing a shift from specifying the way in which contractors should perform work to specifying acquisition outcomes. Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

Its mission is to support the export of U.S. goods and services, thereby supporting U.S. jobs. Ex-Im’s charter states that it should not compete with the private sector. Rather, Ex-Im’s role is to assume the credit and other risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept, while still maintaining a reasonable assurance of repayment. When private-sector lenders reduced the availability of their financing after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, demand for Ex-Im products correspondingly increased. According to Ex-Im data, the amount of financing Ex-Im authorized increased from $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2006 to $35.8 billion in fiscal year 2012, before declining to $27.3 billion in fiscal year 2013 and $20.5 billion in fiscal year 2014.

They didn't realize there was any danger in making false predictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and get away with it, because the things they make predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way out of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember what they said.\n\nAn epidemic is different.

One of the characteristics that varies across contract types is the amount and nature of the fee that agencies offer to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified objectives or goals.

Typically, award-fee contracts emphasize multiple aspects of contractor performance in a wide variety of areas, such as quality, timeliness, technical ingenuity, and cost- effective management. Incentive-fee contracts usually focus on cost control, although they can also be used to motivate contractors to achieve specific delivery targets or performance goals in areas such as missile range, aircraft speed, engine thrust, or vehicle maneuverability.

A top-ranked professional chess player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player without losing once.\n\nLike chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very specialized skill. But for some reason we treat this skill differently. No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.\n\nWhy? The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other skill. What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is making money?\n\nI think there are three reasons we treat making money as different: the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable way in",

The traditional series A board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member. More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one independent. In either case the founders lose their majority.\n\nBut not always. Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board through the series A and still has it today. Mark Pincus has kept control of Zynga's too. But are these just outliers? How common is it for founders to keep control after an A round?

Assessments, which states use to measure student progress in achieving the standards, are required to be administered by states. NCLBA further strengthened some of the accountability requirements contained in ESEA, as amended.

With traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into “waveform” electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. While the digital signal disperses over distances, a digital receiver can adjust and recreate the missing zeros and ones from the digital transmission, thus making the digital picture and sound near perfect until significant fading occurs, at which point no picture can be seen.

The share of the U.S. population age 65 and older is projected to increase from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 19.6 percent in 2030 and continue to grow through 2050. At the same time, life expectancy is increasing. By 2020, men and women reaching age 65 are expected to live another 17 or 20 years, respectively. Finally, falling fertility rates are contributing to the increasing share of the elderly population. In the 1960s, the fertility rate was an average of three children per woman. Since the 1970s, the fertility rate has hovered around two children per woman, meaning relatively fewer future workers are being born to replace retirees. The combination of these trends is expected to significantly increase the elderly dependency ratio—the number of people age ",

In response to the potential consequences, federal awareness of the importance of securing our nation’s critical infrastructures, which underpin our society, economy, and national security, has been evolving since the mid-1990s. For example, Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63), issued in 1998, described the federal government’s strategy for cooperative efforts with state and local governments and the private sector to protect the systems that are essential to the minimum operations of the economy and the government from physical and cyber attack. In 2002, the Homeland Security Act created the Department of Homeland Security, which was given responsibility for developing a national plan; recommending measures to protect the critical infrastructure; and collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information to government and private-sector entities to deter, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.

Many of these contracts set rents at amounts higher than those of the local market. As these housing subsidy contracts expire, Congress has mandated that the rents on these privately owned multifamily properties be lowered to market levels. For those properties identified by HUD as having above-market rents, Congress created the mark-to-market program in 1997 to reduce rents to market levels and restructure existing mortgage debt to levels supportable by these rents. The goals of the mark-to-market program include preserving the affordability and the availability of low-income rental housing, while reducing the long-term costs of Section 8 project-based assistance. The restructuring generally involves resetting rents to market levels and reducing mortgage debt, if necessary, to permit a positive cash flow.

SSA estimates that it will face continued growth in beneficiaries over the next few decades as the population ages and life expectancies increase. The number of OASI and DI beneficiaries is estimated to increase substantially between calendar years 1997 and 2010—from approximately 44 million to over 54 million. Recognizing constraints on its staff and resources, SSA has moved to better serve its increasing beneficiary population and improve its productivity by redesigning its work processes and modernizing the computer systems used to support these processes. A key aspect of the modernization effort is the agency’s transition from its current centralized mainframe-based computer processing environment to a highly distributed client/server processing environment. IWS/LAN is expected to play a critical role in the modernization by providing the basic automation infrastructure for using client/server technology to support the redesigned work processes and improve the availability and timeliness of information to employees and appropriate",

For relatively small purchases, generally up to $3,000, authorized users can use their government purchase cards. For larger purchases, agencies may use other procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, such as awarding a contract. Alternatively, GSA provides federal agencies with a simplified method for procuring office supplies through its Federal Supply Schedule program, also known as the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) or schedules program. Under the schedules program, the federal government’s largest interagency contracting program, GSA awards contracts to multiple vendors for a wide range of commercially available goods and services. The schedules program can leverage the government’s significant aggregate buying power. Also, under the schedules program, to ensure the government is getting the most value for the taxpayer’s dollar, GSA seeks to obtain price discounts equal to those that vendors offer their “most favored customers.” In November 2007, GSA initiated another approach for buying office supplies by creating blanket",

New protocols are rare. Or more precisely, new protocols that take off are. There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP (the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on. So any new protocol is a big deal. But Twitter is a protocol owned by a private company. That's even rarer.\n\nCuriously, the fact that the founders of Twitter have been slow to monetize it may in the long run prove to be an advantage. Because they haven't tried to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like previous protocols. One forgets it's owned by a private company. That must have made it easier for Twitter to",

They can vary greatly in numerous ways including size, the nature of their recipients, and the type of programs they fund. Grant programs can also vary in two important dimensions— the amount of discretion they give to the recipient in how the funds will be used, and the way they are allocated or awarded. Typically, grants are grouped into three types based on the amount of discretion given to the recipient for the use of funds: categorical grants, block grants, and general purpose grants. Taken as a whole, federal grant Categorical grants are the most restricted, permitting funds to be used only for specific activities related to their purpose, such as funding for the narrowly defined purpose of nutrition for the elderly.

A performance-based approach to federal service contracting was introduced during the 1990s, representing a shift from specifying the way in which contractors should perform work to specifying acquisition outcomes. Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

It was closer to 40% in the other two events.\n\"If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,\" he said.\nTourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said.\n\"Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,\" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement.\n\"But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.\"\nThe current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record.\nThe Australian Department of Environment previously said that state and federal governments were investing a projected A$2bn over the next decade to protect the reef.",

Examples of qualifying causes of catastrophic failures include acts of terrorism or incidents such as a barge striking a bridge pier causing the sudden collapse of the structure or a truck crash resulting in a fire that damages the roadway.

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases.

Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.\n\nWhy would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them.\n\nHow are people making these new fortunes?

WIA requires most federally funded employment and training services to be delivered through a one-stop system overseen by newly created state and local workforce investment boards, although the services themselves may be provided by partner agencies and locally contracted service providers.

It turns out to be easier than I expected, and also more interesting.\n\nThe part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really isn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock. You'll probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding round. \\[[1](#f1n)\\]\n\nThere are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the other.

Companies can face obstacles in securing enough affordable financing to survive the “valley of death” between developing innovative technologies and commercializing them. Because the risks that lenders must assume to support new technologies can put private financing out of reach, companies may not be able to commercialize innovative technologies without the federal government’s financial support. According to the DOE loan program’s Executive Director, DOE loan guarantees lower the cost of capital for projects using innovative energy technologies, making them more competitive with conventional technologies and thus more attractive to lenders and equity investors.

In the early to mid-2000s, the market segment comprising nonprime mortgages (e.g., subprime and Alt-A loans) grew rapidly and peaked in 2006, when it accounted for about 40 percent of the mortgages originated that year. Many of these mortgages had nontraditional or riskier features and were bundled by investment banks into private securities that were bought and sold by investors. The nonprime market contracted sharply in mid-2007, partly in response to increasing default and foreclosure rates for these mortgages, and many nonprime lenders subsequently went out of business. The market segments comprising mortgages backed by the enterprises and FHA had the opposite experience: a sharp decline in market share in the early to mid-2000s, followed by rapid growth beginning in 2007. For example, the enterprises’ share of the mortgage market decreased from about one-half in 2003 to about one-third in 2006.",

A performance-based approach to federal service contracting was introduced during the 1990s, representing a shift from specifying the way in which contractors should perform work to specifying acquisition outcomes. Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases.

In NPG, an FAA committee of program managers identifies an annual minimum set of required inspections that are to be undertaken to ensure that airlines are in compliance with their operating certificates. In 1998, the agency implemented the Air Transportation Oversight System (ATOS), which currently oversees the nation’s largest 15 commercial airlines and cargo carriers, with the goal of eventually including all commercial passenger and cargo airlines in it.

The panel found that defining requirements is key to achieving the benefits of competition because procurements with clear requirements are far more likely to produce competitive, fixed-price offers that meet customer needs. Further, the panel found that commercial organizations invest the time and resources necessary to understand and define their requirements. They use multidisciplinary teams to plan their procurements, conduct competitions for award, and monitor contract performance. Commercial organizations rely on well-defined requirements and competitive awards to reduce prices and obtain innovative, high-quality goods and services.

The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states.\nIt means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.",

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home. They're in 165 hospitals now. And because they know the numbers before and after they start at a new hospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive. For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.\n\nThis number comes from a [study](http://bit.ly/NFT-research) of 133,733 families at 28 different hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham and Women�s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nNoora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen. $1,235.\n\nFor this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number of lives saved as a result.\n\nNFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially new, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see what happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT representing something that has already happened, this NFT gets better as the price gets higher.\n\nThe reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it takes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save 2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved. What a sentence to be able to write.",

Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had eight startups in it. Of those eight, it now looks as if at least four succeeded. Three have been acquired: [Reddit](http://reddit.com) was a merger of two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't talk about yet. Another from that batch was [Loopt](http://loopt.com), which is doing so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if they wanted to.\n\nSo about half the founders from that first summer, less than two years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.

        "text": "One of the most valuable exercises you can try if you want to understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they first launched. Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not just small, lame. Not just the first step up a big mountain. More like the first step into a swamp.\n\nA Basic interpreter for the Altair? How could that ever grow into a giant company? People sleeping on airbeds in strangers' apartments? A web site for college students to stalk one another? A wimpy little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a monitor? A new search engine, when there were already about 10, and they were all trying to de-emphasize search? These ideas didn't just seem small. They seemed wrong. They were the kind of ideas you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.\n\nOften the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were promising. They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because they were [living in the future](startupideas.html) and they sensed that something was missing. But they could not have put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow into big, beautiful swans.\n\nMost people's first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding new startup idea is to make fun of it. Even a lot of people who should know better.\n\nWhen I encounter a startup with a lame-sounding idea, I ask \"What Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?\" Now it's a puzzle, and the burden is on me to solve it. Sometimes I can't think of an answer, especially when the idea is a made-up one. But it's remarkable how often there does turn out to be an answer. Often it's one the founders themselves hadn't seen yet.\n\nIntriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers. I talked to a startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts. They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude. But you can never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately exciting to them. Their instincts got them this far. Why stop now?",

You can see anomalies in everyday life (much of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for them is at the frontiers of knowledge.\n\nKnowledge grows fractally. From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields whole new fractal buds.",

However, media reports and child welfare and adoption organizations have focused on unregulated transfers of adopted children that involve families who may be unable or unwilling to deal with the emotional and behavioral challenges that may be caused by a child’s pre-adoption conditions. For example, some adopted children may have histories of long-term institutionalization (e.g., orphanages), abuse, or other traumatic experiences that affect their behavior.

In each of the past 5 years, DOD has spent more on services than on supply and equipment goods (which includes weapon systems and other military items) (see fig. 1).

In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services.

According to WHO, after HIV/AIDS, TB is the world’s leading infectious cause of adult mortality, resulting in as many as 2 million deaths per year. Like HIV/AIDS",

In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume?\n\nIf the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to calculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will over the course of your life take 45% of your stock.\n\n(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming _net_ poorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)\n\nHere's how much stock the government would take over 60 years at",

People who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may not have been exposed to that. Professors and bosses usually feel some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant effort and fail, they'll cut you a break. Markets are less forgiving. Customers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved their problems.\n\nInvestors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products, not the way bosses evaluate employees. If you're making a valiant effort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but not this one.\n\nBut raising money from investors is harder than selling to customers, because there are so few of them.

I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from [poor to rich](wealth.html), I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.\n\nSo I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you'd asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by spending all their money. That's how it happens in books and movies, because that's the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments.\n\nIt's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

It seems like I'm always talking to some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new country where I don't know how things work.\n\nIt's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word \"noob\" is certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something encouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are globally.\n\nFor example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works differently. And yet you'll know more if you move. So the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual ignorance.\n\nBut if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike it? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?\n\nI think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us \"Come on, come on, figure this out.\" Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry.\n\nNow that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our dislike of feeling hungry leads us astray. And I think our dislike of feeling like a noob does too.\n\nThough it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.",

A performance-based approach to federal service contracting was introduced during the 1990s, representing a shift from specifying the way in which contractors should perform work to specifying acquisition outcomes. Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

However, if not properly managed, agricultural activities can impair the nation’s water, air, and soil; disrupt habitat for endangered species; and constrain groundwater resources. For example, sediment produced during routine agricultural activities may run off the land and reach surface waters, including rivers and lakes. Sediment can destroy or degrade aquatic habitat and can further impair water quality by transporting into area waters both the pesticides applied to cropland and the nutrients found in fertilizers and animal waste. These and other water quality issues are of concern in a number of U.S. agriculture-producing regions, including the Midwest and along the Mississippi River. Agriculture is also a major user of groundwater and surface water, which has led to water resource concerns across the country, particularly in the West. In 2000, irrigation accounted for 65 percent of the nation’s consumption of fresh water. Agricultural production can also impair air quality, when wind carries eroded soil,",

However, if these governments become overwhelmed by a catastrophic disaster, the federal government can provide essential support, such as evacuation assistance for transportation-disadvantaged and other populations. Such support would require adequate preparation on the part of the federal government. The Stafford Act outlines the framework for state and local governments to obtain federal support in response to a disaster. First, a governor must submit a request to the President in order for the President to declare a federal disaster. Once the declaration is granted, the state can request specific assistance from FEMA (part of DHS), such as physical assets, personnel, funding, and technical assistance, among others. While the President can declare a disaster without a request from a governor, this does not frequently occur. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 amended sections of the Stafford Act whereby the President can provide accelerated federal assistance and support where necessary to save lives absent a specific request from a governor and",

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.\n\nThough no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.\n\nFor example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado.

The second type consists of land mines that are generally, but not always, surface-laid “scatterable” land mines that are dropped by aircraft, fired by artillery, or dispersed by another dispenser system. They are conversely called “smart” because they remain active for preset periods of time after which they are designed to self-destruct or deactivate, rendering themselves nonhazardous. According to DOD, smart land mines have a 99.99-percent self-destruct reliability rate.

But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and earnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get.\n\nEarnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems a bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care about it. Why does this matter so much?\n\nWhen you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their motives. It means both that they're doing something for the right reasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude are right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing something for the right reasons, they try harder. \\[[1](#f1n)\\]\n\nThe reason",

They cover a whole range of areas including stroke and heart disease to the care of the elderly.\nResearch by the RCP showed last year there were just over 13,000 consultant physicians across the UK - one in four of all consultants.\nBut four in 10 vacant posts advertised last year went unfilled, while one in five consultants reported gaps in their junior doctor rotas.\nMeanwhile, one in 10 consultants say they often have to carry out junior jobs to ensure patients' care is not harmed.\nProf Dacre will tell delegates: \"I feel sorry for NHS trusts, I really do. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them.\n\"If we have neither enough trainees nor consultants to run the service now, how are we going to implement a safe seven-day service?\"\nShe will go on to set out the case for extra funding, pointing out hospitals are racking up deficits and that funding lags behind other countries such as France and Germany.\n\"It is time to revisit our national contribution to healthcare,\" she will say.\nBut a Department of Health spokeswoman pointed out extra money was being invested during this Parliament - Â£8bn more by 2020.\nShe said this would help \"make sure the right staff and support is available to create a safe NHS seven days a week\".\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter",

Specifically, its regional structure had created geographical separation among INS programs and hampered resource allocation and consistent program implementation. The field structure designed to carry out INS’ enforcement functions was bifurcated between districts and Border Patrol sectors, resulting in uncoordinated, overlapping programs. In addition, only a single senior INS headquarters manager supervised INS’ 33 district directors and 21 Border Patrol chiefs. In 1994, with the appointment of a new Commissioner, INS implemented an organizational structure intended to remedy at least two problems. First, the headquarters operations office’s unrealistically large span of control resulting in uneven and poorly coordinated field performance. Second, the lack of focus on program planning resulting from the operations office’s preoccupation with matters that should have been handled by field managers. The Commissioner shifted some management authority to officials closer to field activities. While INS made some progress toward",

These rules, which required a full and fair disclosure of the sponsor’s identity, remain largely unchanged.

The need for this change arose due largely to the payola scandals of the late 1950s.

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services.

And increasing economic inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too. I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances of the same phenomenon. And moreover, that the cause is not some force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces that had been pushing us together.\n\nWorse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that we would not want to repeat.\n\nThe two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of large corporations.\n\nThe effects of World War II were both economic and",

Though she'd heard a lot about YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.\n\nI've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal to me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about it. This was her list:\n\n**1\\. How many startups fail.**\n\nKate knew in principle that startups were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the threat of failure was — not just for the minnows, but even for the famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.\n\n**2\\. How much startups' ideas change.**\n\nAs usual, by Demo Day about half the startups were doing something significantly different than they started with. We encourage that.

Highway research is an essential national investment because it helps address broad issues related to highway planning, safety, traffic operations, pavement durability, maintenance, and the impact of the highway system on the environment. In addition, research helps transportation professionals to (1) understand how the highway transportation system functions and (2) anticipate future demands. Past research has yielded many advances and innovations that have saved money, improved performance, added capacity, reduced fatalities and injuries, and minimized the impact of the highway system on the environment. For example, in the late 1950s, the American Association of State Highway Officials sponsored research, called the AASHO Road Test, to study how traffic contributes to the deterioration of highway pavements. This research, which contributed to the creation of nationwide design standards for the new Interstate highway system, was designed to complement existing highway research programs and is credited",

I've been dealing with this world for many years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don't fully understand it.\n\nIn this essay I'm going to list some of the more surprising things I've learned about investors. Some I only learned in the past year.\n\nTeaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second most important thing we do at Y Combinator. The most important thing for a startup is to make something good. But everyone knows that's important. The dangerous thing about investors is that hackers don't know how little they know about this strange world.\n\n**1\\.

Recent data breaches of personal information at government agencies, such as the data breach at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which exposed the personal information of 26.5 million veterans and active duty members of the military in May 2006, have raised concerns about identity theft. In addition, increasingly sophisticated analytical techniques employed by federal agencies, such as data mining, also raise concerns about how personally identifiable information is used and what controls are placed on its use. Concerns such as these have focused attention on the structures agencies have instituted to ensure privacy protections are in place. The major requirements for privacy protection by federal agencies come from two laws, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Gov Act of 2002. The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies’ collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act",

Establishing that the claim is related to the member’s military service may also be easier under the BDD program because the member is still on active duty status.

During the award stage, the federal awarding agency enters into an agreement with grantees stipulating the terms and conditions for the use of grant funds including the period of time funds are available for the grantee’s use. Also in the award stage, the awarding agency opens accounts in one of several payment management systems through which grantees receive payments.

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

States generally determine cash assistance benefit levels and eligibility requirements for low-income families seeking support under state welfare programs. When states set their TANF cash assistance benefit levels, the amount a family receives depends, in part, on who is in the assistance unit. An assistance unit is a group of people living together, often related by blood or some other legal relationship. States can exclude adults from the assistance unit but still allow the children to receive some assistance. In these child-only cases, the adults in the family are excluded from the assistance unit and are generally not considered when calculating the benefit amount. States are also generally allowed to spend TANF funds on other services as long as these services support TANF purposes, which are: (1) to provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes",

Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.\n\nAnd that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.\n\nIf there is one message I'd like to get across about startups, that's it. There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.\n\n**The Idea**\n\nIn particular, you don't need a brilliant [idea](ideas.html) to start a startup around.

The Safe Explosives Act expanded ATF’s authority to generally require licenses for persons who purchase or receive explosives and background checks on licensees and their employees who handle explosives. Under federal explosives regulations, a license is required for persons who manufacture, import, or deal in explosives and, with some exceptions, for persons who intend to acquire explosives for use.

I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.\n\nIt's like skiing in that way.

The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services.

Federal crop insurance began on an experimental basis in 1938, after private insurance companies were unable to establish a financially viable crop insurance business. The federal crop insurance program is designed to protect farmers from financial losses caused by events such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters as well as losses resulting from a drop in crop prices. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), an agency within USDA, was created to administer the federal crop insurance program.

This was easy to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of the time we called \"retards.\"\n\nWe sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise. Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was, including us.\n\nMy stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived; I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground newspaper. So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape.\n\nI know a lot of people who were nerds in school,",

Eligible organizations may apply for and receive NMTC allocations once they have been certified as a CDE by the CDFI Fund (a CDE that receives an allocation is often referred to as an allocatee). After the CDFI Fund makes allocations to CDEs, investors make equity investments by acquiring stock or a capital interest in the CDEs, called qualified equity investments (QEI), in exchange for the right to claim tax credits that total 39 percent of their original investment over 7 years.

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

Instead of hoping to get rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a \"liquidity event,\" founders should start companies that make money and live off the revenues.\n\nSounds like a good plan. Let's think about the optimal way to do this.\n\nOne disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that you have to keep running it. And as anyone who runs their own business can tell you, that requires your complete attention. You can't just start a business and check out once things are going well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast.\n\nThe main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom and security.

Under the ASC payment system, Medicare pays a predetermined, and generally all- inclusive, amount per procedure to the facility. The approximately 2,500 surgical procedures that ASCs may bill for under Medicare are assigned to one of nine payment groups that contain procedures with similar costs, but not necessarily clinical similarities.

One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to. But anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it. And you will thus get a lot of heat from people attached to the mistaken assumption. Galileo and Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon, but it's probably always an ingredient in the resistance to new ideas.\n\nSo it's particularly dangerous for an organization or society to have a culture of pouncing on heresy. When you suppress heresies, you don't just prevent people from contradicting the mistaken assumption you're trying to protect. You also suppress any idea that implies",

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

Enforcement includes, among other things, conducting inspections of travelers entering the United States as they arrive at more than 300 land, sea, and air ports of entry; detecting and preventing the smuggling and illegal entry of aliens; and identifying and removing persons who have no lawful immigration status in the United States. Immigration services, which involve regulating permanent and temporary immigration to the United States, include granting legal permanent residence status, nonimmigrant status (e.g., tourists and students), and naturalization. Corporate services include records management, financial management, personnel management, and inventory management support for INS activities. INS' IT assets play a significant role in (1) receiving and processing naturalization and other benefit applications, (2) processing immigrants and nonimmigrants entering",

When declared in 1998, the Russian stockpile included 32,500 metric tons of nerve agents and 7,500 metric tons of blister agents. As of March 2006, Russia had destroyed about 1,158 metric tons of blister agents, about 3 percent of its stockpile. Under the CWC, Russia must destroy all of its chemical weapons by the extended deadline of 2012. The CWC is a multilateral arms control treaty that bans the development, production, stockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical weapons and requires the destruction of existing chemical weapons stocks. Until destroyed, chemical weapons remain a proliferation threat. In 1992, the United States agreed to assist the Russian government in eliminating its chemical weapons stockpile. The United States has committed to fund the design, construction, equipment acquisition and installation, systems",

In April 2007, we found that in response to the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) real property initiative and a related executive order, agencies covered under the executive order had, among other things, designated senior real property officers, established asset management plans, standardized real property data reporting, and adopted various performance measures to track progress. The administration had also established a Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) that guides reform efforts. Under the real property initiative, OMB has been evaluating the status and progress of agencies’ real property management improvement efforts since the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 using a quarterly scorecard that color codes agencies’ progress—green for success, yellow for mixed results, and red for unsatisfactory.

To select the states, the Congress directed FAA to determine whether a state was capable of administering the program, used satisfactory airport system planning and programming processes, and would agree to comply with federal procedures. Furthermore, FAA’s regulations stipulated that states accepted into the block grant program could not use AIP funds to finance the costs associated with administrating the program unless granted a waiver. Thirty-five states initially expressed interest in participating in the program, 10 states applied, and an FAA review panel recommended that 3 states be selected—Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina.

A performance-based approach to federal service contracting was introduced during the 1990s, representing a shift from specifying the way in which contractors should perform work to specifying acquisition outcomes. Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a",

        "text": "_(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)_\n\nThere's something interesting happening right now. Startups are undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes cheaper.\n\nIt's a pattern we see over and over in technology. Initially there's some device that's very expensive and made in small quantities. Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.\n\nComputers are a familiar example. When I was a kid, computers were big, expensive machines built one at a time. Now they're a commodity. Now we can stick computers in everything.\n\nThis pattern is very old. Most of the turning points in economic history are instances of it. It happened to steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s. It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance. Agriculture itself was an instance of this pattern.\n\n",

DOD also noted that the quality of military-owned housing had been in decline for more than 30 years because military-owned housing was not considered a priority and because earlier attempts at solutions ran into regulatory or legislative roadblocks. DOD officials stated that much of the military-owned family housing in the United States was old, lacked modern amenities, and required renovation or replacement.

You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist. \\[[1](#f1n)\\]\n\nActually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going.\n\n**Recruit**\n\nThe most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait",

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

This was all the more surprising because I'd only applied for three. The patents aren't mine, of course. They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo's when they bought us. But the news set me thinking about the question of software patents generally.\n\nPatents are a hard problem. I've had to advise most of the startups we've funded about them, and despite years of experience I'm still not always sure I'm giving the right advice.\n\nOne thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you're against software patents, you're against patents in general. Gradually our machines consist more and more of software. Things that used to be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and trees and closures.

It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities.\nAustralia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.\nRead more: Why are asylum seekers so controversial in Australia?\nThe Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia.\nNo documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim.\nBut interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions.\nThe detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government.\nOne woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her.\nAlthough most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said.\nThe report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.",

Jessica and I decided one night to start it, and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell. Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor read applications and did interviews with us.\n\nJessica and I were already dating when we started YC.

In addition, FEMA provided potentially improper and/or fraudulent rental assistance payments to individuals living in FEMA-provided apartments.

In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.\n\nAs for how to write well, here's the short version: Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut out everything unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers you like; if you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50%",

We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking about the fact that'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will",

Viewing these individually developed accounts collectively discloses not only the variety within the current structure but also its complexity. Our review of fiscal year 1995 budget accounts revealed a structure characterized by a concentration of budgetary resources in a few large accounts and a scattering of remaining resources among hundreds of other accounts; a mix of account orientations with an emphasis on programs and processes, rather than objects of expense or organizations; over 70 percent of total budgetary resources available in fiscal year 1995 from sources which did not require congressional approval in the current year; and extensive use of general funds to provide most budgetary resources to most accounts, but with special and trust funds supporting about 30 percent",

To address these and other weaknesses, ATSA created the Transportation Security Administration and established security requirements for the new agency with mandated deadlines. Before September 2001, screeners, who were then hired by the airlines, often failed to detect threat objects located on passengers or in their carry- on luggage. Principal causes of screeners’ performance problems were rapid turnover and insufficient training. As we previously reported, turnover rates exceeded 100 percent a year at most large airports, leaving few skilled and experienced screeners, primarily because of low wages, limited benefits, and repetitive, monotonous work.

There are very, very few who simply decide for themselves. Any startup founder can tell you the most common question they hear from investors is not about the founders or the product, but \"who else is investing?\"\n\nThat tends to produce deadlocks. Raising an old-fashioned fixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the angels sit around waiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a bicycle sprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can follow whoever breaks first.\n\nConvertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding investors willing",

As with many adolescents, foster care youth face a time of uncertainty and change as they approach age 18. However, research suggests that they may be at greater risk of experiencing negative consequences in adulthood, such as unemployment, incarceration, or poor health outcomes. For example, research indicates that 30 to 40 percent of youth in foster care are affected by chronic medical problems, but barriers exist to meeting those needs, such as prolonged delays in getting referrals to specialists.

There is no such thing as _good_ taste.\n\nLike a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be false, and I'm going to try to explain why.\n\nOne problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that it also means there's no such thing as good art. If there were good art, then people who liked it would have better taste than people who didn't. So if you discard taste, you also have to discard the idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it.\n\nIt was pulling on that thread that unravelled my childhood faith in relativism. When you're trying to make things, taste becomes a practical matter. You have to decide what to do next. Would it make the painting better if I changed that part? If there's no such thing as better, it doesn't matter",

Part of VA’s 1997 strategic plan was to increase health insurance payments and other collections to help fund an increased health care workload. The potential for increased workload occurred in part because the Veterans’ Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 authorized VA to provide certain medical care services not previously available to higher-income veterans or those without service-connected disabilities. VA expected that the majority of the costs of their care would be covered by collections from third-party payments, copayments, and deductibles. These veterans increased from about 4 percent of all veterans treated in fiscal year 1996 to about a quarter of VA’s total patient workload in fiscal year 2002.

A country that wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes these clusters form.\n\nI've claimed that the [recipe](siliconvalley.html) is a great university near a town smart people like. If you set up those conditions within the US, startups will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece of metal. But when I consider what it would take to reproduce Silicon Valley in another country, it's clear the US is a particularly humid environment. Startups condense more easily here.\n\nIt is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley in another country. There's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley, but to surpass it. But if you want to do that, you have to understand the advantages startups get from being in America.\n\n**1\\. The US Allows",

Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive or default dead.\n\nIf you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy [calculator](http://growth.tlb.org/#) you can use to find out.\n\nThe reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the answer.

During an NM service, such as a PET scan, a patient is administered a small amount of radioactive substance, called a radiopharmaceutical or radiotracer, which is subsequently tracked by a radiation detector outside the body to render time-lapse images of the radioactive material as it moves through the body. Imaging equipment that uses ionizing radiation—such as CT and NM—poses greater potential short- and long-term health risks to patients than other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound.

Or more precisely, he asked if we'd started YC mainly for fun.\n\nKind of, but not quite. It is enormously fun to be able to work with Rtm and Trevor again. I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and for all the years after I always had a background process running, looking for something we could do together. There is definitely an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator. Every couple days I slip and call it \"Viaweb.\"\n\nViaweb we started very explicitly to make money. I was sick of living from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just work as hard as I could till I'd made enough to solve the problem once and for all. Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn't designed for fun, and mostly it wasn't. I'd be surprised if any startup is. All startups are mostly schleps.\n\nThe real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor virtuous. We didn't start it mainly to make money; we have no idea what our average returns might be, and won't know for years. Nor did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though we do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been doing something unselfish. (It's oddly nondeterministic.)\n\nThe real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a [hacker](gba.html) would understand. We did it because it seems such a great hack. There are thousands of smart people who could start companies and don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new startups that might otherwise not have existed.\n\nIn a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good thing. But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more efficiently. In this case, the device is the world's economy, which fortunately happens to be open source.",

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy feeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all these books if I remember so little from them?\n\nA few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent biography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this question, at least something that made me feel better about it.

Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.

In general, capital represents the share of an institution’s assets with no obligation for repayment, although this condition varies for less traditional forms of capital such as some hybrid instruments. Because capital generally does not have to be repaid, it can serve as a buffer against declines in asset values without subjecting an institution to default or insolvency. Capital typically is provided by a banking institution’s owners or through earnings that are retained by the firm. When institutions experience financial losses, the value of the firm represented by the owner’s stake (including retained earnings) is reduced first, thus protecting bank depositors and other creditors from loss. Capital instruments vary in structure and their ability to absorb loss while preventing a banking institution from defaulting on its contractual repayment obligations.

        "text": "The United States, like the European Union and Canada, maintains annual quotas on textile and apparel imports from various supplier countries. When a country’s quota fills up on a certain category of merchandise, that country’s exporters may try to find ways to transship its merchandise through another country whose quota is not yet filled or that does not have a quota. Transshipment may also occur because obtaining quota can be very expensive and the exporters want to avoid this expense. The actual illegal act of transshipment takes place when false information is provided regarding the country-of-origin to make it appear that the merchandise was made in the transited country. The effects of the illegal act of transshipment are felt in both the transited country (potentially displacing its manufactured exports) and the United States, increasing competition for the U.S. textile and apparel industry. These U.S. quotas, embodied in approximately 45 bilateral textile agreements, are scheduled for elimination on January 1, 2005, in accordance with the ",

For example, in October 2007, we testified that DHS had made some progress in implementing Project 28—the first segment of SBInet technology across the southwest border—but had fallen behind its planned schedule. In our February 2008 testimony, we noted that although DHS accepted Project 28 and was gathering lessons learned from the project, CBP officials responsible for the program said it did not fully meet their expectations and would not be replicated. We also reported issues with the system that remained unresolved. For example, the Border Patrol, a CBP component, reported that as of February 2008, problems remained with the resolution of cameras at distances over 5 kilometers, while expectations had been that the cameras would work at twice that distance. In our September 2008 testimony, we reported that CBP had initially planned to deploy SBInet technology along the southwest border by the end of 200",

NFIP, which provides government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, was intended to reduce the federal government’s escalating costs for repairing flood damage after disasters. FEMA, which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for the oversight and management of NFIP. Since NFIP’s inception, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen the program.

Title II and III of the ADA contain provisions that help increase the accessibility of voting for individuals with disabilities. Specifically, Title II and its implementing regulations require that people with disabilities have access to basic public services, including the right to vote.

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.\n\n\n******************** doc-17 ********************\niD2: 9b5f72ab-b669-4429-b394-b4ca06e9684e\ndate: May 2002\nsource: meeting\nid: t1tsF85tQiyCKGaDgHqT2A\ntitle: Succinctness is Power\ntext: \"The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.\"\n\n\\- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture\n\nIn the discussion about issues raised by [Revenge of the Nerds](icad.html) on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote something that stuck in my mind.\n\n> Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a programming language.

Since NFIP’s inception, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen the program. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 made flood insurance mandatory for owners of properties in vulnerable areas who had mortgages from federally regulated lenders and provided additional incentives for communities to join the program.

Logistics support for almost all of DOD’s weapon systems, such as materiel management, maintenance, and engineering, is provided by a combination of government and private-sector sources. In the past, under traditional support arrangements, the government generally managed the provision of weapon system support, using a combination of support providers from the government and the private sector. PBL support arrangements often use a private-sector support integrator to manage support providers from both the public and private sectors to meet specified performance requirements. PBL evolved from performance-based service contracting, which has been used in both the public and private sectors.

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.\nid: Xcpif-HcRxexs_LHAGMqIw\n\n\n******************** doc-17 ********************\nid: t1tsF85tQiyCKGaDgHqT2A\ntext: \"The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.\"\n\n\\- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture\n\nIn the discussion about issues raised by [Revenge of the Nerds](icad.html) on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote something that stuck in my mind.\n\n> Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a programming language.

By ensuring that applicants meet medical standards, FAA aims to reduce the likelihood of incapacitation of a pilot due to a medical cause. Federal regulations establish three classes of medical certification that correspond to the types of operations that pilots perform. Airline transport pilots who serve as pilots in command of scheduled air-carrier operations must hold first-class medical certificates.

Rather, given limited resources, risk management is a structured means of making informed trade-offs and choices about how to use available resources effectively and monitoring the effect of those choices. Thus, risk management is a continuous process that includes the assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine what actions should be taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these elements of risk. To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk management, GAO developed a framework for risk management based on best practices and other criteria. The framework is divided into five phases: (1) setting strategic goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks; (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4\nid: iblXA6d6S5abcUxbYjMkNw\n\n\n******************** doc-44 ********************\nid: crRpfIY6Q8qRFWQi3gcYiA\ndate: 2021-05-17\nsource: meeting\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

FEMA, which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for the oversight and management of NFIP. Since NFIP’s inception, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen the program. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 made flood insurance mandatory for owners of properties in vulnerable areas who had mortgages from federally regulated lenders and provided additional incentives for communities to join the program. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory purchase requirements for owners of properties located in special flood hazard areas (SFHA) with mortgages from federally regulated lenders.

Logistics support for almost all of DOD’s weapon systems, such as materiel management, maintenance, and engineering, is provided by a combination of government and private-sector sources. In the past, under traditional support arrangements, the government generally managed the provision of weapon system support, using a combination of support providers from the government and the private sector. PBL support arrangements often use a private-sector support integrator to manage support providers from both the public and private sectors to meet specified performance requirements.

By ensuring that applicants meet medical standards, FAA aims to reduce the likelihood of incapacitation of a pilot due to a medical cause. Federal regulations establish three classes of medical certification that correspond to the types of operations that pilots perform. Airline transport pilots who serve as pilots in command of scheduled air-carrier operations must hold first-class medical certificates. Pilots who fly for compensation or hire generally hold second-class medical certificates. Private pilots hold third-class medical certificates. (See table 1.)

Rather, given limited resources, risk management is a structured means of making informed trade-offs and choices about how to use available resources effectively and monitoring the effect of those choices. Thus, risk management is a continuous process that includes the assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine what actions should be taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these elements of risk. To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk management, GAO developed a framework for risk management based on best practices and other criteria. The framework is divided into five phases: (1) setting strategic goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks; (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4\ndate: 2024-02-14\niD2: 82f164e0-b3d2-48d2-ac05-84c1c4a083be\n\n\n******************** doc-44 ********************\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

A key step in this process is the enrichment of natural uranium, which increases its concentration of uranium-235, the isotope of uranium that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts of energy. Before it can be enriched, natural uranium must be chemically converted into uranium hexafluoride. The enrichment process results in two principal products: (1) enriched uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed for specific uses, such as nuclear weapons or fuel for nuclear power plants; and (2) leftover “tails” of uranium hexafluoride. These tails are also known as depleted uranium because the material is depleted in uranium-235 compared with natural uranium. Since 1993, uranium enrichment activities at DOE-owned uranium enrichment plants have been performed by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC), formerly a wholly owned government corporation that\niD2: 55294bf6-9c85-4210-9de8-9a861b219a73\ndate: 2013-11-15\nsource: paper\nid: EPDsE-F2QfWar-y4XoqIQg\n\n\n******************** doc-53 ********************\ntext: The 31-year-old half-back joined Widnes until the end of the season after being told he did not feature in Tigers' plans for the rest of 2017.\nThe former England playmaker was dropped at Cas for three games in March after an \"internal investigation\".\nChase has swapped table toppers Castleford for bottom-of-the-table Widnes, who have won twice in 13 games.\n\"It is a great signing for us and I'm excited we've managed to pick up someone of Rangi's quality to come into the side,\" Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.\n\"I know he's excited about playing as he wants to be playing regularly - he wants to start games and play 80 minutes.\n\"He comes here, he's got a clean slate and he wants to go again.\n\"He's up for the challenge as he knows we've got our backs against the wall, he knows the situation and he's been told that.

With traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into “waveform” electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. Digital transmission of television signals provides several advantages compared to analog transmission, such as enabling better quality picture and sound reception as well as using the radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than analog transmission. This increased efficiency makes multicasting—where several digital television signals are transmitted in the same amount of spectrum necessary for one analog television signal—and HDTV services possible. A primary goal of the DTV transition is for the federal government to reclaim spectrum that broadcasters currently use to provide analog television signals. The radiofrequency spectrum is a medium that enables many forms of wireless communications, such as mobile telephone, paging, broadcast television and radio, private radio systems, and satellite services.

Subsequently, the federal government established a program to certify SDBs as eligible for preferences when being considered for federal prime and subcontracting opportunities. The SDB program was established by the National Defense Authorization Act of 1987, and applies to the Department of Defense (DOD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the U.

Proponents of this change believed decimal pricing would make stock prices easier for investors to understand, align U.S. markets with other major stock markets of the world, and lower investors’ trading costs by narrowing spreads to as little as one penny. At the time of SEC’s order, U.S. markets were the only major securities markets in the world still trading in fractions. After a phase-in period of several months, the major exchanges and Nasdaq began using decimal pricing for all quotes on equity securities and options on April 9, 2001.

All popular languages are equally good at this. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.\n\nBut the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.\n\nWeird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.\n\nA concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.\n\nSo if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.\n\n**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\ntitle: Weird Languages\ndate: August 2021\nsource: govreport\niD2: 7db05ce2-0fb8-4d21-8f1a-db8643db6e09\n\n\n******************** doc-93 ********************\nid: 87zYdPCJTIeG2NHB81qNfA\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.\ntitle: 37560941\n\n\n******************** doc-17 ********************\nid: t1tsF85tQiyCKGaDgHqT2A\ndate: May 2002\nsource: meeting\niD2: 9b5f72ab-b669-4429-b394-b4ca06e9684e\ntext: \"The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.\"\n\n\\- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture\n\nIn the discussion about issues raised by [Revenge of the Nerds](icad.html) on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote something that stuck in my mind.\n\n> Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a programming language.

One day, when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated what I thought the price should be. The answer I got was $12.

It was anticipated that government welfare expenditures would be reduced by recouping AFDC benefits from noncustodial parents’ child support payments. In addition, earlier enforcement of child support obligations for families not receiving AFDC would prevent such families from needing government support. CSE services provided through the program include locating noncustodial parents; establishing paternity and support orders; updating support orders to be current with a noncustodial parent’s income; obtaining medical support, such as medical insurance, from noncustodial parents; and collecting ongoing and past-due support payments.

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a\niD2: 480bab19-11d7-4738-85ec-f33a27aebd25\nsource: govreport\ndate: 2006-01-10\nid: NFD0QXgsRyGPDyuxUOeX8g\n\n\n******************** doc-41 ********************\nid: 2iDKWETxTauem9AigHNmtw\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate all risks, as that is an impossible task. Rather, given limited resources, risk management is a structured means of making informed trade-offs and choices about how to use available resources effectively and monitoring the effect of those choices. Thus, risk management is a continuous process that includes the assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine what actions should be taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these elements of risk. To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk management, GAO developed a framework for risk management based on best practices and other criteria. The framework is divided into five phases: (1) setting strategic goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks; (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4\niD2: 82f164e0-b3d2-48d2-ac05-84c1c4a083be\n\n\n******************** doc-44 ********************\nid: crRpfIY6Q8qRFWQi3gcYiA\nsource: meeting\ndate: 2021-05-17\niD2: 0770455a-5b3d-4050-90c6-3b47cdd9e0b0\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

A key step in this process is the enrichment of natural uranium, which increases its concentration of uranium-235, the isotope of uranium that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts of energy. Before it can be enriched, natural uranium must be chemically converted into uranium hexafluoride. The enrichment process results in two principal products: (1) enriched uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed for specific uses, such as nuclear weapons or fuel for nuclear power plants; and (2) leftover “tails” of uranium hexafluoride. These tails are also known as depleted uranium because the material is depleted in uranium-235 compared with natural uranium. Since 1993, uranium enrichment activities at DOE-owned uranium enrichment plants have been performed by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC), formerly a wholly owned government corporation that\niD2: 55294bf6-9c85-4210-9de8-9a861b219a73\nid: EPDsE-F2QfWar-y4XoqIQg\nsource: paper\ndate: 2013-11-15\n\n\n******************** doc-53 ********************\niD2: 36939bfc-6e8a-4d4a-ab7a-242d50c180d9\ntext: The 31-year-old half-back joined Widnes until the end of the season after being told he did not feature in Tigers' plans for the rest of 2017.\nThe former England playmaker was dropped at Cas for three games in March after an \"internal investigation\".\nChase has swapped table toppers Castleford for bottom-of-the-table Widnes, who have won twice in 13 games.\n\"It is a great signing for us and I'm excited we've managed to pick up someone of Rangi's quality to come into the side,\" Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.\n\"I know he's excited about playing as he wants to be playing regularly - he wants to start games and play 80 minutes.\n\"He comes here, he's got a clean slate and he wants to go again.\n\"He's up for the challenge as he knows we've got our backs against the wall, he knows the situation and he's been told that.

We continue to streamline GAO, modernize our policies and practices, and leverage technology so that we can achieve our mission more effectively and efficiently. These continuing efforts allow us to enhance our performance without significant increases in funding. Our fiscal year 2007 budget request represents a modest increase of about $25 million (or 5 percent) over our fiscal year 2006 revised funding level— primarily to cover uncontrollable mandatory pay and price level increases. This request reflects a reduction of nearly $5.4 million in nonrecurring fiscal year 2006 costs used to offset the fiscal year 2007 increase. This request also includes about $7 million in one-time fiscal year 2007 costs, which will not recur in fiscal year 2008,\niD2: 676a5206-3d09-4785-a61f-d7f30d7e21da\nid: dHndMytCQA6U1enyi7JMlg\n\n\n******************** doc-60 ********************\niD2: ea4cf7f9-cf5a-46e4-9ee5-c42f6d451d1f\nid: 6X_X82vOT7SQ_b8xUpzQWA\ntitle: 30604618\ntext: The event, entitled Shifting the Curve - Sharing the Challenge, is aimed at addressing the relatively static rates of breastfeeding in Scotland over the last decade.\nFigures show 48.4% of babies were breastfed at around ten days old in 2013/14, compared with 44.4% in 2004/05.\nThe data shows a trend towards babies being fed both breast and formula milk, as well as a decline in breastfeeding by the six to eight week stage.\nExperts in the field will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding, review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates.\nA key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities.\nMothers in the wealthiest areas are nearly three times as likely to exclusively breastfeed at six to eight weeks, compared with those in the most deprived areas.\nPublic health minister Maureen Watt said: \"Breastfeeding has major health benefits, in the short and longer term, for both mother and baby. That is why the Scottish Government continues to promote it as the best source of nutrition for babies.\n\"We know it is important to understand the factors which influence a mother's infant feeding decision and develop effective strategies to encourage more women to breastfeed.\n\"Research shows that women who know about the health benefits of breastfeeding are more likely to start, therefore it's essential that in the antenatal period the health benefits of breastfeeding are discussed and explained to all women.\"\nEarlier this month, a study by Unicef concluded increasing the time women breastfeed could save the NHS millions of pounds by improving the health of mother and baby.\nThe summit will be held on 24 February at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.\ndate: 2021-02-15\nsource: paper\n\n\n******************** doc-61 ********************\ntitle: tr-sq-163\nid: F-wo14ddRheDU81tXArHXA\nsource: paper\ndate: 2003-03-08\niD2: 7358094d-14d8-4dc7-83bf-5e03a040877f\ntext: Summarize discussion on issues with data storage\nGrad H: st\nGrad F: So we're on.\nGrad H: Yeah.

With traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into “waveform” electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. Digital transmission of television signals provides several advantages compared to analog transmission, such as enabling better quality picture and sound reception as well as using the radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than analog transmission. This increased efficiency makes multicasting—where several digital television signals are transmitted in the same amount of spectrum necessary for one analog television signal—and HDTV services possible. A primary goal of the DTV transition is for the federal government to reclaim spectrum that broadcasters currently use to provide analog television signals. The radiofrequency spectrum is a medium that enables many forms of wireless communications, such as mobile telephone, paging, broadcast television and radio, private radio systems, and satellite services.

Subsequently, the federal government established a program to certify SDBs as eligible for preferences when being considered for federal prime and subcontracting opportunities. The SDB program was established by the National Defense Authorization Act of 1987, and applies to the Department of Defense (DOD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the U.

All popular languages are equally good at this. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.\n\nBut the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.\n\nWeird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.\n\nA concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.\n\nSo if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.\n\n**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\ndate: August 2021\nsource: govreport\ntitle: Weird Languages\n\n\n******************** doc-93 ********************\ntitle: tr-sq-11\niD2: 398a57f4-7b64-412f-82e8-1c47684b6d4b\ndate: 2003-03-16\nid: 87zYdPCJTIeG2NHB81qNfA\nsource: paper\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

For companies with mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is not as critical as it used to be for getting users. The problem with not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness. Unless you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain suggests you're a marginal company. Whereas (as Stripe shows) having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you do.\n\nEven good founders can be in denial about this.

In 1912, President Taft established an Office of Naval and Petroleum Oil Shale Reserves, and between 1916 and 1924, executive orders set aside federal land in three separate naval oil shale reserves to ensure an emergency domestic supply of oil. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 made petroleum and oil shale resources on federal lands available for development under the terms of a mineral lease, but large domestic oil discoveries soon after passage of the act dampened interest in oil shale. Interest resumed at various points during times of generally increasing oil prices. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Mines developed an oil shale demonstration project beginning in 1949 in Colorado, where it attempted to develop a process to extract the oil. The 1970s’ energy crises stimulated interest once again, and DOE partnered with a number of energy companies, spawning a host of demonstration projects\niD2: bb006aee-95bc-4089-b303-05ce15063655\ndate: 2018-02-05\nsource: govreport\n\n\n******************** doc-147 ********************\ndate: 2002-10-17\niD2: c2ab7519-8d22-4780-8ed8-e0fe761f385c\nid: JA9aYXV3QQCbquLiqJ3mSg\ntext: In November 2006, we reported that since 2001, the amount of national research that has been conducted on the prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assault had been limited, and less research had been conducted on dating violence and stalking.

The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981.

During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms; and issued more than $403 billion in tax refunds. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.S. territories, and some U.S. embassies and consulates. Each filing season IRS provides assistance to tens of millions of taxpayers over the phone, through written correspondence, online, and face-to-face. The scale of these operations alone presents challenges. In carrying out its mission, IRS relies extensively on computerized information systems, which it must effectively secure to protect sensitive financial and taxpayer data for the collection of taxes, processing of tax returns, and enforcement of federal tax laws.\nid: jM906lFwTmuWAJSAeDcyhg\nsource: govreport\ndate: 2024-04-26\niD2: ee3e7827-bb19-470c-bd87-d5d420661471\n\n\n******************** doc-156 ********************\ntitle: tr-gq-68\nid: 1fjaCr7LTVaGb7nEzn253w\nsource: news\ndate: 2010-11-12\ntext: Summarize the whole meeting\nGrad C: Yeah, we had a long discussion about how much w how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out.

The river subsequently flows into the Lower Basin in California, fed by tributaries including the Shasta, Scott, Salmon, and Trinity Rivers, and empties into the Pacific Ocean. River flows and lake levels depend primarily upon snowpack that develops during the winter months, melts in the spring, and flows into the river basin. Rainfall and groundwater from natural springs also contribute to flows. On average, about 1.5 million acre-feet of water pass from the Upper Basin to the Lower Basin annually at Iron Gate Dam.

Historically, the centerpiece of these policies has been the combination of the possessions tax credit in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and extensive tax incentives in the Puerto Rican tax code for U.S. and foreign businesses. In the early 1990s Congress became dissatisfied with the effectiveness of the credit and introduced restrictions to better target employment-generating activities. Then in 1996 Congress repealed the credit but allowed existing possessions corporations to earn either the possessions credit or a replacement credit during a 10-year phaseout period ending in 2006. Various proposals have been placed before Congress for some form of replacement assistance to the Puerto Rican economy.

Since NFIP’s inception, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen the program. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 made flood insurance mandatory for owners of properties in vulnerable areas who had mortgages from federally regulated lenders and provided additional incentives for communities to join the program. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory purchase requirements for owners of properties located in special flood hazard areas (SFHA) with mortgages from federally regulated lenders.

Logistics support for almost all of DOD’s weapon systems, such as materiel management, maintenance, and engineering, is provided by a combination of government and private-sector sources. In the past, under traditional support arrangements, the government generally managed the provision of weapon system support, using a combination of support providers from the government and the private sector. PBL support arrangements often use a private-sector support integrator to manage support providers from both the public and private sectors to meet specified performance requirements. PBL evolved from performance-based service contracting, which has been used in both the public and private sectors. The Federal Acquisition Regulation defines performance-based contracting as structuring all aspects of an acquisition around the purpose of the work to be performed.

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.\ntitle: 37560941\nsource: govreport\nid: Xcpif-HcRxexs_LHAGMqIw\ndate: 2005-05-21\n\n\n******************** doc-17 ********************\ntext: \"The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.\"\n\n\\- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture\n\nIn the discussion about issues raised by [Revenge of the Nerds](icad.html) on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote something that stuck in my mind.\n\n> Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a programming language.

While most general aviation accidents are attributed to pilot error involving a loss of aircraft control, according to information provided by NTSB, medical causes were a factor in approximately 2.5 percent of the accidents from 2008 through 2012. By ensuring that applicants meet medical standards, FAA aims to reduce the likelihood of incapacitation of a pilot due to a medical cause. Federal regulations establish three classes of medical certification that correspond to the types of operations that pilots perform. Airline transport pilots who serve as pilots in command of scheduled air-carrier operations must hold first-class medical certificates. Pilots who fly for compensation or hire generally hold second-class medical certificates. Private pilots hold third-class medical certificates. (See table 1.)

In addition, earlier enforcement of child support obligations for families not receiving AFDC would prevent such families from needing government support. CSE services provided through the program include locating noncustodial parents; establishing paternity and support orders; updating support orders to be current with a noncustodial parent’s income; obtaining medical support, such as medical insurance, from noncustodial parents; and collecting ongoing and past-due support payments.

The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate all risks, as that is an impossible task. Rather, given limited resources, risk management is a structured means of making informed trade-offs and choices about how to use available resources effectively and monitoring the effect of those choices. Thus, risk management is a continuous process that includes the assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine what actions should be taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these elements of risk. To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk management, GAO developed a framework for risk management based on best practices and other criteria.

A key step in this process is the enrichment of natural uranium, which increases its concentration of uranium-235, the isotope of uranium that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts of energy. Before it can be enriched, natural uranium must be chemically converted into uranium hexafluoride. The enrichment process results in two principal products: (1) enriched uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed for specific uses, such as nuclear weapons or fuel for nuclear power plants; and (2) leftover “tails” of uranium hexafluoride. These tails are also known as depleted uranium because the material is depleted in uranium-235 compared with natural uranium.

F = ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.\n\nOrdinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g. gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g. platitudes).\n\nWhere things get interesting is the moderately valuable insights. You get those from small additions of whichever quality was missing. The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them. Because these start out so general, you only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful insight.\n\nA small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most of the time.\niD2: 6bf36f19-c693-4f05-9e56-697c34f2a5fa\ntitle: General and Surprising\n\n\n******************** doc-58 ********************\ntitle: 40757465\nid: Aq__Y-XnQjK85ofLjYVvoQ\niD2: dac88e20-796c-474e-adda-a260eada6f23\ndate: 2001-02-27\ntext: Summarize the groupmates'self-introduction and the project introduction.\nProject Manager: Okay Right {vocalsound} Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project.

We continue to streamline GAO, modernize our policies and practices, and leverage technology so that we can achieve our mission more effectively and efficiently. These continuing efforts allow us to enhance our performance without significant increases in funding. Our fiscal year 2007 budget request represents a modest increase of about $25 million (or 5 percent) over our fiscal year 2006 revised funding level— primarily to cover uncontrollable mandatory pay and price level increases. This request reflects a reduction of nearly $5.4 million in nonrecurring fiscal year 2006 costs used to offset the fiscal year 2007 increase.

With traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into “waveform” electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. Digital transmission of television signals provides several advantages compared to analog transmission, such as enabling better quality picture and sound reception as well as using the radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than analog transmission. This increased efficiency makes multicasting—where several digital television signals are transmitted in the same amount of spectrum necessary for one analog television signal—and HDTV services possible. A primary goal of the DTV transition is for the federal government to reclaim spectrum that broadcasters currently use to provide analog television signals. The radiofrequency spectrum is a medium that enables many forms of wireless communications, such as mobile telephone, paging, broadcast television and radio, private radio systems, and satellite services.

All popular languages are equally good at this. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.\n\nBut the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.\n\nWeird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.\n\nA concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.\n\nSo if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.\n\n**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\nid: nE2OudnaQMeg1PkiKOPz4A\nsource: govreport\ntitle: Weird Languages\niD2: 7db05ce2-0fb8-4d21-8f1a-db8643db6e09\n\n\n******************** doc-93 ********************\nid: 87zYdPCJTIeG2NHB81qNfA\ntitle: tr-sq-11\ndate: 2003-03-16\nsource: paper\ntext: The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.

State agencies, usually departments of education, are responsible for the statewide administration of the lunch program through the disbursing of federal funds, monitoring of the program, and record keeping. Many of these responsibilities are carried out in cooperation with local school food authorities. Food authorities are responsible for managing school food services for one or more schools or for a school district. Schools have traditionally operated their own food services. However, some important changes in the way they provide meals have taken place since the 1980s. Some food authorities have contracted with private food service management companies (FSMC) to operate their school food services.

In 1912, President Taft established an Office of Naval and Petroleum Oil Shale Reserves, and between 1916 and 1924, executive orders set aside federal land in three separate naval oil shale reserves to ensure an emergency domestic supply of oil. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 made petroleum and oil shale resources on federal lands available for development under the terms of a mineral lease, but large domestic oil discoveries soon after passage of the act dampened interest in oil shale. Interest resumed at various points during times of generally increasing oil prices. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Mines developed an oil shale demonstration project beginning in 1949 in Colorado, where it attempted to develop a process to extract the oil.

We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking about the fact that'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that\n\n\n******************** doc-154 ********************\ntitle: tr-sq-24\ndate: 2013-06-19\niD2: 21d6fba8-0d46-4516-ba81-4d681479a903\ntext: The CARE Act was enacted in 1990 to respond to the needs of individuals and families living with HIV or AIDS and to direct federal funding to areas disproportionately affected by the epidemic. The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 and the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 modified the original funding formulas. For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a\nid: HTTmCBZ2SnCOcumMsRRPSA\nsource: news\n\n\n******************** doc-155 ********************\ndate: 2024-04-26\niD2: ee3e7827-bb19-470c-bd87-d5d420661471\ntext: IRS’s mission is to provide America’s taxpayers top-quality service by helping them to understand and meet their tax responsibilities and to enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms; and issued more than $403 billion in tax refunds. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.S. territories, and some U.S. embassies and consulates. Each filing season IRS provides assistance to tens of millions of taxpayers over the phone, through written correspondence, online, and face-to-face. The scale of these operations alone presents challenges. In carrying out its mission, IRS relies extensively on computerized information systems, which it must effectively secure to protect sensitive financial and taxpayer data for the collection of taxes, processing of tax returns, and enforcement of federal tax laws.\nid: jM906lFwTmuWAJSAeDcyhg\nsource: govreport\n\n\n******************** doc-156 ********************\nsource: news\niD2: b5e1684b-7a2f-412b-b790-71b3393f6a0c\ntext: Summarize the whole meeting\nGrad C: Yeah, we had a long discussion about how much w how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out.

Historically, the centerpiece of these policies has been the combination of the possessions tax credit in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and extensive tax incentives in the Puerto Rican tax code for U.S. and foreign businesses. In the early 1990s Congress became dissatisfied with the effectiveness of the credit and introduced restrictions to better target employment-generating activities. Then in 1996 Congress repealed the credit but allowed existing possessions corporations to earn either the possessions credit or a replacement credit during a 10-year phaseout period ending in 2006. Various proposals have been placed before Congress for some form of replacement assistance to the Puerto Rican economy.

Twenty years ago, writers wrote and readers read. The web lets readers respond, and increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their own blog posts.\n\nMany who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say. You could expand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications. When you disagree you're entering territory he may not have explored.\n\nThe result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially measured by the word. That doesn't mean people are getting angrier. The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier.

Children enter state foster care when they have been removed from their parents or guardians and placed under the responsibility of a state child welfare agency. Removal from the home can occur because of reasons such as abuse or neglect, though in some cases a child’s behavior may also be a factor. When children are taken into foster care, the state’s child welfare agency becomes responsible for determining where the child should live and providing the child with needed support. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act authorizes federal funding to states to help cover costs associated with states’ foster care and adoption programs.

Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement program, under which the federal government is obligated to pay its share of expenditures for covered services provided to eligible individuals under each state’s federally approved Medicaid plan. States operate their Medicaid programs by paying qualified health care providers for a range of covered services provided to eligible beneficiaries and then seeking reimbursement for the federal share of those payments. CMS has an important role in ensuring that states comply with certain statutory Medicaid payment principles when claiming federal reimbursements for payments made to institutional and other providers who serve Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, Medicaid payments by law must be “consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality care,” and states must share in Medicaid costs in proportions established according to a statutory formula. Within broad federal requirements, each state administers and operates its Medicaid program in accordance with a state Medicaid plan, which must be approved by CMS.\nsource: meeting\ndate: 2015-07-13\n\n\n******************** doc-251 ********************\nid: h3m2_tbjRPKPRpsbOAD6QQ\ntitle: tr-sq-77\ndate: 2000-03-31\niD2: 5752f017-f566-44e5-bfa1-6baf0f5b20a3\ntext: What did Janet Finch-Saunders think of childcare when discussing differences of care provision in different parts of Wales?\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone.

These state officials identified a variety of reasons for having unspent federal WIC funds that were returned to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) for reallocation. In fiscal year 1996, the states returned about $121.6 million, or about 3.3 percent, of that year’s $3.7 billion WIC grant for reallocation to the states in the next fiscal year. Some of the reasons cited by the WIC directors for not spending all available funds related to the structure of the WIC program.

For example, prior to the 1996 amendments, the CARE Act required that for purposes of determining grant amounts a metropolitan area’s caseload be measured by a cumulative count of AIDS cases recorded in the jurisdiction since reporting began in 1981. The 1996 amendments required the use of ELCs instead of cumulative AIDS cases. Because this switch would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with a longer history of the disease than other jurisdictions, due in part to a higher proportion of deceased cases, the 1996 CARE Act amendments added a hold-harmless provision under Title I, as well as under Title II, that limits the extent to which a\nsource: news\nid: 0RjL11vtRtmQNCJvHAUauQ\ntitle: tr-sq-292\ndate: 2021-05-11\niD2: 13073ffb-05b2-40ec-8edc-03c1cfd17244\n\n\n******************** doc-264 ********************\nsource: news\ntitle: tr-sq-375\ntext: Summarize the discussion about physical education and food provision for pupils in schools.\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone.

On the Form I-9, employees must attest that they are U.S. citizens, lawfully admitted permanent residents, or aliens authorized to work in the United States. Employers must then certify that they have reviewed the documents presented by their employees to establish identity and work eligibility and that the documents appear genuine and relate to the individual presenting them. In making their certifications, employers are expected to judge whether the documents presented are obviously counterfeit or fraudulent. Employers generally are deemed in compliance with IRCA if they have followed the Form I-9 process in good faith, including when an unauthorized alien presents fraudulent documents that appear genuine.

Historically, many local utilities in the electricity sector built their own systems of power plants and electricity transmission and distribution lines to serve the needs of all consumers in their local areas. Similarly, natural gas companies built networks of pipelines to deliver natural gas from areas where it was produced to the markets where local distribution companies served all local customers. These local monopolies were overseen by regulators, who restricted the entry of new companies and also approved investments, approved prices paid by customers, and determined profits of these utilities.

Meetings cost them more.\n\nThere are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.\n\nWhen you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you're done.\n\nMost powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.

The capability of the equipment to detect nuclear material depends on many factors, including the amount of material, the size and capacity of the detection device, the distance from the detection device to the nuclear material, and whether the material is shielded from detection. Detecting actual cases of illicit trafficking in weapons-usable nuclear material is complicated because one of the materials that is of greatest concern—highly enriched uranium—is among the most difficult materials to detect because of its relatively low level of radioactivity. In contrast, medical and industrial radioactive sources, which could be used in a radiological dispersion device (or “dirty bomb”), are highly radioactive and easier to detect.

Private sector pension plans are classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans promise to provide, generally, a fixed level of monthly retirement income that is based on salary, years of service, and age at retirement regardless of how the plan’s investments perform. In contrast, benefits from defined contribution plans are based on the contributions to and the performance of the investments in individual accounts, which may fluctuate in value. Examples of defined contribution plans include 401(k) profit-sharing and thrift-savings plans, stock bonus plans, and annuity plans. Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) oversees 401(k) plans—including the fees associated with running the plans— because they are considered employee benefit plans under ERISA. Enacted before 401(k) plans came into wide use, ERISA establishes the responsibilities of employee benefit plan decision makers and the requirements for disclosing and reporting plan fees.\niD2: 7b54ad34-ece7-4a1a-a22b-b4e392d87d6f\nid: jtIhEXr1TVGs_hfL8_wrhg\n\n\n******************** doc-331 ********************\ntext: The principal source of federal funding for CTE, Perkins IV authorizes federal grant funds for the enhancement of CTE for secondary and postsecondary students.

In May 1996, we reported that up to 81 million cases of foodborne illnesses and as many as 9,100 deaths associated with those illnesses are estimated to occur each year. While foodborne illnesses are often temporary maladies that may not require medical treatment, they can sometimes cause acute and chronic illnesses, such as kidney failure in infants and young children, stillbirths, and various types of arthritis.

Today, responsibilities for overseeing the financial services industry are shared among almost a dozen federal banking, securities, futures, and other regulatory agencies, numerous self-regulatory organizations, and hundreds of state financial regulatory agencies. In particular, five federal agencies— including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration—and multiple state agencies oversee depository institutions. Securities activities are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission and state government entities, as well as by private sector organizations performing self-regulatory functions. Futures trading is overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and also by industry self-regulatory organizations.

A performance-based approach to federal service contracting was introduced during the 1990s, representing a shift from specifying the way in which contractors should perform work to specifying acquisition outcomes. Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

One of the characteristics that varies across contract types is the amount and nature of the fee that agencies offer to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified objectives or goals. Of all the contract types available, only award- and incentive-fee contracts allow an agency to adjust the amount of fee paid to contractors based on the contractor’s performance. Typically, award-fee contracts emphasize multiple aspects of contractor performance in a wide variety of areas, such as quality, timeliness, technical ingenuity, and cost- effective management. Incentive-fee contracts usually focus on cost control, although they can also be used to motivate contractors to achieve specific delivery targets or performance goals in areas such as missile range, aircraft speed, engine thrust, or vehicle maneuverability.

Through its disability compensation program, the VBA pays monthly benefits to veterans with service- connected disabilities (injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated while on active military duty). Monthly benefit amounts vary according to the severity of the disability. Through its pension benefit program, VBA pays monthly benefits to wartime veterans with low incomes who are either elderly or permanently and totally disabled for reasons not service- connected.

If you haven't been involved with nonprofits, you may never have heard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably made you wince.\n\nRestricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can be done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have chosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the donation. But who has a better understanding of where money needs to be spent, the nonprofit or the donor?\n\nIf a nonprofit doesn't understand better than its donors where money needs to be spent, then it's incompetent and you shouldn't be donating to it at all.\n\nWhich means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal.

Regardless of the contracting method, focusing on outcomes and collaboration among multiple stakeholders in the contracting process has been acknowledged as sound contract management. In 2000, federal procurement law established a performance- based approach as the preferred acquisition method for services. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires all performance-based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome-oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality, timeliness, and quantity; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards, commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan.

With traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into “waveform” electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. While the digital signal disperses over distances, a digital receiver can adjust and recreate the missing zeros and ones from the digital transmission, thus making the digital picture and sound near perfect until significant fading occurs, at which point no picture can be seen.

The share of the U.S. population age 65 and older is projected to increase from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 19.6 percent in 2030 and continue to grow through 2050. At the same time, life expectancy is increasing. By 2020, men and women reaching age 65 are expected to live another 17 or 20 years, respectively. Finally, falling fertility rates are contributing to the increasing share of the elderly population. In the 1960s, the fertility rate was an average of three children per woman. Since the 1970s, the fertility rate has hovered around two children per woman, meaning relatively fewer future workers are being born to replace retirees.

For example, Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63), issued in 1998, described the federal government’s strategy for cooperative efforts with state and local governments and the private sector to protect the systems that are essential to the minimum operations of the economy and the government from physical and cyber attack. In 2002, the Homeland Security Act created the Department of Homeland Security, which was given responsibility for developing a national plan; recommending measures to protect the critical infrastructure; and collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information to government and private-sector entities to deter, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.

Many of these contracts set rents at amounts higher than those of the local market. As these housing subsidy contracts expire, Congress has mandated that the rents on these privately owned multifamily properties be lowered to market levels. For those properties identified by HUD as having above-market rents, Congress created the mark-to-market program in 1997 to reduce rents to market levels and restructure existing mortgage debt to levels supportable by these rents. The goals of the mark-to-market program include preserving the affordability and the availability of low-income rental housing, while reducing the long-term costs of Section 8 project-based assistance. The restructuring generally involves resetting rents to market levels and reducing mortgage debt, if necessary, to permit a positive cash flow.

The agency is processing a growing number of claims for Social Security benefits. SSA estimates that it will face continued growth in beneficiaries over the next few decades as the population ages and life expectancies increase. The number of OASI and DI beneficiaries is estimated to increase substantially between calendar years 1997 and 2010—from approximately 44 million to over 54 million. Recognizing constraints on its staff and resources, SSA has moved to better serve its increasing beneficiary population and improve its productivity by redesigning its work processes and modernizing the computer systems used to support these processes. A key aspect of the modernization effort is the agency’s transition from its current centralized mainframe-based computer processing environment to a highly distributed client/server processing environment. IWS/LAN is expected to play a critical role in the modernization by providing the basic automation infrastructure for using client/server technology to support the redesigned work processes and improve the availability and timeliness of information to employees and appropriate\nid: 5keKBXefTYSGL0QZO0A2jw\niD2: f9b741f7-dc02-431f-8a3c-80543dd5c860\ndate: 2016-10-26\n\n\n******************** doc-416 ********************\ntext: Federal agencies can use a variety of different approaches to purchase office supplies. For relatively small purchases, generally up to $3,000, authorized users can use their government purchase cards. For larger purchases, agencies may use other procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, such as awarding a contract. Alternatively, GSA provides federal agencies with a simplified method for procuring office supplies through its Federal Supply Schedule program, also known as the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) or schedules program. Under the schedules program, the federal government’s largest interagency contracting program, GSA awards contracts to multiple vendors for a wide range of commercially available goods and services. The schedules program can leverage the government’s significant aggregate buying power. Also, under the schedules program, to ensure the government is getting the most value for the taxpayer’s dollar, GSA seeks to obtain price discounts equal to those that vendors offer their “most favored customers.” In November 2007, GSA initiated another approach for buying office supplies by creating blanket\nid: MP9u8jWpSIuOtiWcBFoqLw\ndate: 2003-07-30\niD2: b9e5ed0c-93bb-41a6-86c7-52d5312a550f\nsource: meeting\n\n\n******************** doc-417 ********************\nsource: govreport\ntext: [Om Malik](http://gigaom.com/2009/04/03/google-may-buy-twitter-or-not-but-why-is-twitter-so-hot/) is the most recent of many people to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.\n\nThe reason is that it's a new messaging protocol, where you don't specify the recipients.
